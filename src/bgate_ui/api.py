"""The HTTP contract every route module shares.

The QA audit's loudest cross-cutting finding: two mutually exclusive error
conventions coexisted (FastAPI's ``{detail}`` at 4xx and ``200 {ok: false,
error}``), so the frontend gave up and wrapped every fetch in
``.catch(() => ({}))``, which does not even fire on a 500, because a 500 body
is still valid JSON. Every failure in the product rendered as a blank panel.

One envelope, always::

    {"ok": true,  "data": <payload>}
    {"ok": false, "error": {"code": "not_found", "message": "...", "detail": {...}}}

``code`` is machine-readable and stable; ``message`` is a sentence a human can
act on. Handlers raise :class:`ApiError` (or any HTTPException, it is coerced)
and never hand-roll an error body.

Also here because every router needs it and nobody should re-derive it:
pagination, the actor identity that makes reviews accountable, and the
same-origin + bearer-token guard on the mutating surface.

# WHY safe_error IS A CONSTANT, see its docstring. The scrubbing that used to
# live here (bgate_core.board.streamer, via a cached Redactor) is gone with it: it
# could not clear the finding, and every response it protected now carries no
# exception text to protect. The streamer-mode middleware in bgate_ui.redact is
# untouched and is still the filter that runs when a camera is on the screen.
def safe_error(exc: BaseException) -> str:
    """A constant. Nothing derived from the exception goes into a response.

    THE REASON IT IS A CONSTANT AND NOT A SCRUBBED MESSAGE. CodeQL's
    py/stack-trace-exposure query has an abstract Sanitizer class with ZERO
    implementations, read it: python/ql/lib/semmle/python/security/dataflow/
    StackTraceExposureCustomizations.qll. There is no sanitizer, so no amount of
    redaction clears the finding; the only thing that does is the taint not
    reaching an HTTP response body at all. Earlier attempts here scrubbed the
    message (still flagged) and then logged it instead (a HIGH for clear-text
    logging, worse than the MEDIUM it replaced).

    WHAT THIS DOES NOT COST, WHICH IS THE POINT. It is only reached from an
    `except` block wrapping an unexpected failure. Every DELIBERATE refusal in
    the product raises ApiError with a message written as a literal in our
    source, "a sequence needs a name", "first_frame ... resolves outside the
    project", and those never touch this function, never carried taint, and are
    unchanged. What is lost is the text of failures nobody anticipated, which
