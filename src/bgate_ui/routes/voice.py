"""Talking to an agent: a mic relay and a speech endpoint. The key stays here.

THE PROBLEM THIS MODULE IS SHAPED BY. Deepgram's realtime STT is a websocket
that the CLIENT normally opens holding the API key. Doing that from this
dashboard would put DEEPGRAM_API_KEY into page JavaScript, where it is readable
by the devtools console, by any script the page ever loads, and by anything that
can scrape the DOM — the same class of exposure that put a key in a commit once
already and is why bgate_core/runtime/providers.py has no getter.

TWO HONEST OPTIONS. THE RELAY WON.

  RELAY (this module).       The browser streams PCM to a FastAPI websocket on
                             loopback; this process holds the key and relays
                             both ways. The key never leaves the machine, in any
                             form, for any duration.
  SHORT-LIVED TOKEN.         Deepgram documents POST /v1/auth/grant, which mints
                             a JWT with `usage:write` and a ttl_seconds of 1-3600
                             (default 30). The browser would connect straight to
                             Deepgram with it.

The grant is a real, well-designed feature and the reason it lost is not that it
is insecure — it is two facts about THIS product:

1. THE LATENCY ARGUMENT DOES NOT APPLY HERE. A relay costs one extra hop, and
   for a normal web app that hop crosses the internet. This dashboard binds to
   127.0.0.1 and the browser is on the same machine, so the hop is loopback:
   sub-millisecond, against a network leg to Deepgram measured in tens of
   milliseconds. The headline advantage of the token is worth approximately
   nothing at this address.
2. THE STREAM CEILING GOES BLIND WITHOUT IT. If the browser talks to Deepgram
   directly, this process never learns how many minutes were transcribed, and
   MAX_STREAM_BYTES below — the only thing stopping a tab left open with a hot
   mic — has nothing to count. The relay counts the bytes it forwards.

Against that, `usage:write` is account-wide for its TTL rather than scoped to
one stream, and a socket opened with a 30-second token stays open long after it
expires. Short, but not zero, and bought nothing here.

SO: no endpoint in this file returns, embeds or logs a key, and no key appears in
a URL. deepgram.auth_header() is the only thing that reads one and it is called
inside the two functions that talk to Deepgram.

WEBSOCKETS ARE NOT COVERED BY api.install_guard. That middleware is registered
with @app.middleware("http") and Starlette never runs it for a websocket scope —
so the loopback-Host check, the origin check and the dashboard-token check that
protect every other mutating endpoint DO NOT protect /api/voice/listen. They are
re-done here, by hand, in _accept(). Getting this wrong would mean any page in
the browser could open the user's microphone relay and bill their Deepgram
account, which is worse than the endpoints the guard was written for.

THE TOKEN ARRIVES AS THE FIRST MESSAGE, NOT AS A QUERY PARAMETER. The browser
WebSocket API cannot set request headers, so the two choices are ?token=... and a
handshake frame. A query string lands in uvicorn's access log and in anything
that ever proxies this, which is the rule routes/providers.py already states for
API keys and applies just as well to the credential that guards them.
