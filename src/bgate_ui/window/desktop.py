"""`bgate app` — the dashboard in a native window instead of a browser tab.

The dashboard is already a local-only web app talking to a local store over
loopback, so there is nothing to port: this starts the same uvicorn server on a
background thread and points a native webview at it. On Windows that webview is
Edge WebView2, which ships with Windows 11 — no runtime to install, no Node
toolchain, no second copy of Chromium in the wheel.

pywebview is an OPTIONAL dependency (`pip install "builders-gate[desktop]"`).
Everything here degrades to a clear instruction if it is missing, because the
browser dashboard is still a complete way to use the product.
